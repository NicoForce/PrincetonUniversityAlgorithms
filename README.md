# Princeton Algorithms
 
This repository was created to track progress on Princeton Algorithms course I'm taking in Coursera.

The folders are divided by part(P), module(M), lecture and language (by default the course is being taken in Java, so if a folder has no mention to any language, it's probably in Java)
